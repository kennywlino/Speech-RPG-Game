Did this thing win
I love the car of my dad
I will cook some good food soon
I heard a bird singing early in the morning
Today I did not feel very comfortable
My father saw her at work
Next vacation I would love to visit the river
I love that t-shirt you got from the cheap thrift store
What is her name I must have forgotten it
Park the car in town
The cheese was bad
When I was young I had a very nice hat
My school teacher comes from Spain
The first sculpture he built was stored in a basement
The expression was very special and exquisite
