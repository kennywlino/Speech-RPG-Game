Did this thing win?
I love my dad’s car
I’ll cook some good food soon
I heard a bird singing early in the morning
Today I did not feel very comfortable
My father saw her at work
Next vacation I’d love to visit the river
I love that cheap churros shop, the one that has a push sign
What’s her name? I must have forgotten it
Park the car in town
The cheese was bad
When I was young I had a very nice hat
My school teacher comes from Spain
The first sculpture he built was stored in a basement
The expression was very special and exquisite
