The thirty-three thieves thought that they thrilled the throne throughout Thursday
Can you can a can as a canner can can a can
I wish to wish the wish you wish to wish, but if you wish the wish the witch wishes, I will not wish the wish you wish to wish
There those thousand thinkers were thinking how did the other three thieves go through
I scream, you scream, we all scream for ice cream
A big black bug bit a big black dog on his big black nose
How many cookies could a good cook cook if a good cook could cook cookies? A good cook could cook as much cookies as a good cook who could cook cookies
Four furious friends fought for the phone
Three short sword sheaths
The queen in green screamed
Six slimy snails sailed silently
I thought, I thought of thinking of thanking you
Seven slick slimy snakes slowly sliding southward
Roofs of mushrooms rarely mush too much
The ruddy widow really wants ripe watermelon and red roses when winter arrives
